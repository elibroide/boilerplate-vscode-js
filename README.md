# boilerplate-vscode-js

A boilerplate to help get started with JS/Node projects, specifically catering developers who use Visual Studio Code.

## Features

* Sensible .editorconfig file
* Prettier + ESlint + Standard (JS) linting that will automatically format your code on save according to the opinions of Prettier and Standard
* Auto-save files on focus change (can be disabled in **.vscode/settings.json**)
* Browser-sync for rapid front-end development, run `yarn dev`
